Hi there! You know when you look back to the past and realize how much did you change?

Well... This code is pretty much that, my first Java application, which was developed in 2008 and was running from 2008 to 2013 with little to none maintenance. Of course I would make a lot of different things nowadays, but hey, this is good, right?
This software was very important to this client, I'm sharing 'cause maybe can help someone interested in developing JTAPI softwares for Cisco Call Manager (CUCM). I remember that (in 2008) I had hard times looking for documentation and samples on the web.
Last advise: I'm mainly a .NET developer, so the code may be a little dotnetty in several places (I was learning Java).
